## Loanable Funds Market Model

-   Determines the level of the real interest rate, R, such that aggregate savings equals aggregate investment

-   The total supply of goods and services, Y, equals Aggregate demand (C + I + G)

-   Total demand of funds is aggregate investment by firms

-   Total supply of funds is aggregate savings by households

-   Price of money is the real interest rate, return to savers or cost to investors

-   Demand for loanable funds comes from firms looking to borrow to finance the rental of machinery at cost r

## Model Understanding

-   Endogenous vs. exogenous variables
    -   Endogenous variables are labeled on the axis of the plot
    -   Exogenous variables are variables outside of the plot
-   Factors of production
    -   K: capital; tools, machines and structures used in production
    -   L: labor; the physical and mental efforts of workers
-   Production Function: Y = F(K,L)
    -   Shows how much output (Y) the economy can produce from K units of capital and L units of labor
    -   Reflects the economy's level of technology
    -   Exhibits constant returns to scale
-   Assumptions
    -   Technology is fixed
    -   Factors and product markets are perfectly competitive
        -   Firms and households are price takers
        -   Zero economic profits
    -   All prices are fully flexible as we focus on long run
    -   The economy's supplies of capital and labor are fixed because factor price are flexible

### Price Determination

-   Factor prices are determined by supply and demand in factor markets

-   Supply of each factor is fixed

### Marginal Product of Labor

-   The extra output the firm can produce using an additional unit of labor (holding other inputs fixed)

$MPL = F(K,L + 1) - F(K,L)$

-   When increasing *L* while holding *K* constant, we typically see a decreasing output per unit of added labor

    -   To understand, consider a single machine representing *K*, adding more labor *L* while keeping *K* constant will mean more labor sharing the same amount of *K*

### Demand for Labor

-   Real Wage is nominal wages normalized by price of output

-   If we assume that firms are price takers in the labor market, then real wage is given, and quantity of labor demanded will equal where real wage = Marginal Product of Labor, or the Labor demand curve

### Equlibrium of Real Wage

-   In the wider economy, real wage is now variable (fixed and given for an individual firm)

-   If all participating firms are assumed to be alike, they will have a similar *MPL*

-   In the wider economy, the point at which Labor supply in the economy equals aggregate *MPL* or demand for labor across all firms in the economy determines the equalibrium real wage

### Components of GDP

$Y = C + I + G + NX$

where...

-   *Y* = Value of Total Output
-   *C* = Consumption
-   *I* = Investment
-   *G* = Government Spending
-   *NX* = Net eXports
-   *C + I + G + NX* = Aggregate expenditure

#### Consumption

-   Consumption or disposable income is defined as total income minus total taxes: *Y - T*

-   Consumption function: $C = C(Y - T) = mpc(Y-T)$

-   Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the change in C when disposable income increases by one dollar

#### Investment

-   The investment function is I = I(r), where r denotes the real interest rate, the nominal interest rate corrected for inflation
