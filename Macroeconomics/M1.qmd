## Measuring GDP

### Two definitions:

    -   Total expenditures on domestically produced final goods and services

    - Total income earned by domestically located factors of production

* Expenditure equals income because every dollar a buyer spends becomes income to the seller

* Value added is the value of output minus the value of the intermediate goods used to produce that output

* GDP = value of final goods produced = sum of value added at all stages of production

* The value of the final goods already includes the value of the intermediate goods, so including intermediate and final goods in GDP would be double counting

### Expenditure Components of GDP

    - Consumption, _C_
    - Investment, _I_
    - Government Spending, _G_
    - Net exports, _NX_

    Equation:

    $Y = C + 1 + G + NX$

#### Consumption

    - Definition: The value of all goods and services bought by households including:
        - Durable goods
        - Nondurable goods
        - Services

#### Investment and Capital

    - Investment is spending on new capital
        - This is different from financial investment which is refered to as savings in this class

#### Government Spending (G)

    - G includes all government spending on goods and services
    - G excludes transfer payments
    (e.g., unemployment insurance payments) as they do not represent spending on goods and services

#### Net Exports (NX) 

    - NX = exports - imports

        - Exports: The value of goods and services sold to other countries

        - Imports: The value of goods and services purchased from other countries
    
    - NX equals net spending from abroad on goods and services
