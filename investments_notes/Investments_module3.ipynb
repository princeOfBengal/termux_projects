    "    - Market capitalization rate is 14%\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $V_{0} = \\frac{D_{1}}{k-g} = \\frac{3 * 1.08}{.14-.08} = \\$54$\n",

    "* Implications of Dividend Discount Model:\n",
    "    - The stock's value will be greater the larger it's expected dividend per share\n",

    "    - The stock's value will be greater the higher the expected growth rate of dividends\n",

    "##### Estimating Dividend Growth Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dividend Growth Rate: $g = ROE * b$\n",
    "    - $g$ = growth rate of dividends\n",
    "    - $ROE$ = Return on Equity\n",
    "    - $b$ = plowback or retention rate (b = 1-dividend payout ratio)\n",
    "    - This works best when a firm achieves a steady ROE, if ROE is unsustainably high, the formula doesn't work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Present Value of Growth Opportunities\n",
    "* The value of the firm equals:\n",
    "    - The value of the assets already in place +\n",
    "    - The NPV of its future investments or the PV of growth opportunities\n",
    "    - Price/Share = No-growth value/share + PV Growth Opportunity\n",
    "    - $P_{0} = \\frac{E_{1}}{k} + PVGO$    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Poor Reinvestment\n",
    "    - Earnings of \\$5/share\n",
    "    - Firm reinvests 60% of its earnings\n",
    "    - Expected year-end dividend is \\$2/share\n",
    "    - Project generates ROE of 10%\n",
    "    - Capitalization rate is 15% \n",
    "        - Project ROE is less than the required return on capital\n",
    "        - Capitalization rate is used as the discount rate\n",
    "        - Suggests that the company's internal opportunities for return are not very good compared to the rest of the market\n",
    "    - $g = ROE * b = 10\\% * .6 = 6%$\n",
    "    - $P_{0} = \\frac{\\$2}{15\\% - 6\\%} = \\$22.22$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - PVGO = Price / share - no-growth value/share\n",
    "        - $PVGO = \\$22.22 - \\frac{5}{.15} = -\\$11.11$\n",
    "        - PVGO is negative because the firm insists on retaining all earnings $5 and investing in projects with lower return than the cost of capital; it should just pay out all earnings $5 as dividends to raise the stock valuation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two-Stage Dividend Discount Model\n",
    "    - Stage 1 involves discounting individual dividend payments to present value\n",
    "    - Stage 2 involves discounting perpetual future dividends to present value\n",
    "    - $V_{0}$ = current value\n",
    "    - g = terminal (long-term) dividend growth rate\n",
    "    - k = required rate of return\n",
    "        - k can be estimated as the CAPM expected return\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - $V_{0} = \\frac{D_{1}}{(1+k)^{1}} + \\frac{D_{2}}{(1+k)^{2}} + \\frac{D_{3}}{(1+k)^{3}} + \\frac{D_{4}}{(k-g)(1+k)^{3}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Stage 2 part of the formula ($\\frac{D_{4}}{(k-g)(1+k)^{3}}$) is a pertuity formula\n",
    "        - the discounting of $D_{4}$ by $k-g$ gets you the discounted values of perpetual dividends at time = 3\n",
