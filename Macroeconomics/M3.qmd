## The Quantity Theory of Money and Inflation

-   Money: The stock of assets that can be readily used to make transactions

-   Money Supply: The quantity of money available in the economy

-   Monetary Policy: control over the money supply

-   Monetary policy is conducted by the central bank

-   Money supply equals currency plus demand deposits

    -   $M = C + D$

-   Reserves (R): The portion of deposits that banks have not lent

-   Fractional Reserve System: Banks hold a fraction of deposits as reserves

    -   $M = \frac{1}{rr} * C$
        -   *rr* : reserve ratio

-   Monetary Base (B) : C + R

    -   C is controlled by Central Bank
    -   R is controlled by regulation

-   Reserve-deposit ratio: rr = R / D

    -   depends on regulation and bank policies

-   Currency-deposit ratio: cr = C/D

    -   depends on households' preferences

### Solving for Money Supply

$$
M = C + D = \frac{C + D}{B} * B = m * B
$$ *where*:

$$
m = \frac{C + D}{B}= \frac{C + D}{C + R} = \frac{(C/D) + (D/D)}{(C/D) + (R/D)} = \frac{cr + 1}{cr + rr} 
$$

-   The quantity equation has 4 uses:

    -   Velocity, demand for money, long run inflation, aggregate demand

### Money Velocity

-   The rate at which money circulates

$ V = \frac{P * Y}{M} $

-   
    -   V = Velocity

    -   M = Money in circulation

    -   P = Price of output (GDP Deflator)

    -   Y = Quantity of output (real GDP)

    -   P \* Y = nominal GDP

-   $M^{s}$ is controlled by the central bank, Y is constant in the long run

-   Money market must be in equilibrium, therefore real money supplied must be equal to real money balances demanded

-   $MV = PY$

-   How much real money balances do people want to hold for a given level of real income? $(M/P)^{d} = kY$
