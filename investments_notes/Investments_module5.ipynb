    "## Efficient Market Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "* The theory that stocks reflect all available information\n",
    "* Reflevent information and news is considered random and unpredictable, and as stock prices reflect available information, stock price changes follow a random walk; stock prices go up and down regardless of past performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competition as the Source of Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information is the most precisous financial commodity\n",
    "* Analysts have an incentive to discover information and use it to make money\n",
    "* Strong competition assures prices reflect all information\n",
    "* Once prices reflect information, it becomes more difficult to make money\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency Differs Across Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small stocks receive less analyst coverage than loarge stocks in the US\n",
    "* Emerging markets are less intensely analyzed than US markets and may have less rigourous disclosure requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inefficiency's Negative Impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inefficient markets imply there is systematic resource misallocation\n",
    "    - Firms with overvalued securities can raise capital too cheaply\n",
    "    - Firms with undervalued securities may pass up profitable opportunities because their cost of capital is unfairly high\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Financial research can assess the impact of an event on a firm's stock price\n",
    "* The abnormal return due to the event is the difference between the stock's actual return and a proxy for the stock's return in the absence of the event\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "* Returns are examined to determine if they are abnormal compared to what they would have been without the event\n",
    "    - Proxy for normal returns in the absence of the even can be the market model (CAPM)\n",
    "    - $r_{t} = \\alpha + \\beta r_{Mt} + e_{t}$\n",
    "        - $\\alpha + \\beta r_{Mt}$ represents the predicted returns according to the market model without the event (CAPM)\n",
    "        - $e_{t}$ is a residual figure and represents the effect of the event; we can rearrange the market model to solve for $e_{t}$\n",
    "            - $e_{t} = r_{t} - (\\alpha + \\beta r_{Mt})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Stock Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Technical Analysis: search for patterns in stock prices and trading volumes. The patterns are used to predict price movement\n",
    "    - Successful technical analysis depends on a sluggish response of stock prices to supply-demand factors\n",
    "* Fundamental Analysis: Uses earnings and dividend prospects of the firm to determine proper (or intrinsic) stock prices\n",
    "    - Analysis seeks firms that are mispriced\n",
    "\n",
    "### Versions of Efficient Market Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Three levels of efficiency within the Efficient Market Hypothesis to reflect differing definitions of _all available information_; all versions assert that prices reflect __all available information__\n",
    "    - Weak\n",
    "    - Semi-strong\n",
    "    - Strong\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EMH Weak Form\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weak-form assets that stock prices already reflect all information that can be derived by examining market trading data such as historical pricing, trading volumes, or short interest\n",
    "\n",
    "* As all relevent information used for technical analysis is already priced in, weak-form efficiency implies that __technical analysis is useless__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EMH Semi-strong form\n",
    "\n",
    "* Semi-strong states that all publicaly available information regarding the prospects of a firm are already reflected in stock prices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information include past prices, fundemental data on firm's product line, quality of management, balance sheet composition, patents held, earnings forecasts, dividend prospects, and accounting practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implies that fundemental and technical analysis is useless\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EMH Strong Form\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strong-form states that all relevant information to the firm is already reflected in the stock price; even insider information\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implies that insider information, technical and fundemental analysis is useless\n",
    "    - This is hard to believe\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications of EMH on Management Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficient Market Hypothesis implies that the costs of research are too onerous for small players, only large portfolios can afford it\n",
    "* Active Portfolio Management is an expensive strategy that takes significant resources to be successful\n",
    "    - Clients pay high fees to cover costs of resources and trading (analyst time, data, trading comissions)\n",
    "    - Must beat markets consistently to be worthwhile\n",
    "    - Suitable for very large portfolios where analysts have a comparative advantage\n",
    "    - Frequent selling may triger greater tax liabilities \n",
    "\n",
    "* Passive Portfolio Management does not attempt to beat the market; just accepts market returns\n",
    "    - Very low costs (low fees for investors) as few resources needed to manage passive portfolios\n",
    "\n",
    "* EMH implies that passive investment strategy is the most efficient\n",
    "    - There is a little point in paying high fees for analysis that is unlikely to lead to superior performance\n"

    "## Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conventional vs Behavioral Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conventional Finance:\n",
    "    - Prices are correct and qual to instrinsic value\n",
    "    - Resources are allocated efficiently\n",
    "    - Consistent with EMH\n",
    "\n",
    "* Behavioral Finance: \n",
    "    - Assumes investors do not behave rationally\n",
    "    - Arbitrageurs are limited and therefore insufficient to force prices to match intrinsic value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Categories of Irrationalities\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information Processing Errors: Investors do not always process information correctly; as such investors form incorrect opinions of probability distributions for future returns\n",
    "    - Limited attention span, underreaction, and overreaction; reliance on heuristics due to limited time/attention\n",
    "    - Overconfidence; people tend to overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts, and they tend to overestimate their abilities\n",
    "    - Extrapolation, pattern recognition, representative bias; Individuals are adept at discerning patterns, even percieving patterns that don't actually exist\n",
    "\n",
    "* Behavioral Biases: Even when given a correct probability distribution of returns, investors may make inconsistent or suboptimal decisions\n",
    "    - Framing: Decisions affected by how choices are described, such as whether uncertainty is posed as potential gains from a low baseline livel, or as losses from a higher baseline level\n",
    "    - Mental accounting: Specific form of framing in which people segregate certain decisions\n",
    "    - Regret avoidance: Individuals who make decisions that turn out badly have more regret when that decision was more unconventional\n",
    "    - Affect and feelings: Investors tend to choose stocks with higher affect (i.e. stocks they admire) driving prices up and returns down\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limits to Arbitrage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Behavioral biases would not matter if rational arbitrageurs could fully exploit the mistakes of behavioral investors; bringing the price back to rational levels\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The problem with this statement is that markets can remain irrational longer than the arbitrageurs can remain solvent\n",
    "\n",
    "* Behavioral Finance often explains bubbles as a result of overconfidence and representativeness biases\n",
